Rails very own interpretation of REST

GET    /pictures        => index:   collection of pictures
GET    /pictures/1      => show:    picture with the id 1
GET    /pictures/new    => new:     form for creating a picture
POST   /pictures        => create:  create a new picture
GET    /pictures/1/edit => edit:    form for updating a picture
PUT    /pictures/1      => update:  update the picture with the id 1
DELETE /pictures/1      => destroy: delete the picture with the id 1
